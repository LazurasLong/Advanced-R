# Advanced R

### Course Description

Welcome to Advanced Analytics with R\! This short course builds onto the
[Intro to R](https://github.com/uc-r/Intro-R) and [Intermediate
R](https://github.com/uc-r/Intermediate-R) courses and provides a
hands-on approach to applying advanced analytic techniques with the R
programming language. In this course you will gain deeper knowledge
around the analytic modeling process and apply various supervised and
unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The following is an outline of
the material covered in this training:

***Schedule is still being refined and is subject to change; however,
the topics should remain the same.***

### Course Preparation

To prepare for this course please complete the following ***prior*** to
the day of class:

1.  Download the class material
    [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cpz3lqwr963x6mt/AAAdGTNgiiwdDg9SmawSmyjGa?dl=1).
    This will provide you with the R scripts and notebooks to follow
    along during class.

2.  After downloading the files, open the `00-run-this-script-first.R`
    and run the code. This will make sure you have all required packages
    that will be used in the class.

3.  All slides are available via the hyperlinks in the schedule above so
    that you can follow along.

4.  Please have the following versions of R and RStudio installed. If
    you have an earlier version of R that is at least version 3.4.5 or
    later you should be ok but its best to be as current as possible.
    
      - R: 3.5.1 \[[download latest
        version](https://cran.r-project.org/)\]
      - RStudio: 1.1.463 \[[download latest
        version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)\]

5.  This course makes ***strong*** assumptions about your prior
    knowledge such as your ability to define functions, manage R
    objects, control the flow of a program, and other basic tasks. To
    ensure your success, be sure that you have reviewed and are
    comfortable with the material covered in the [Intro to
    R](https://github.com/uc-r/Intro-R) and [Intermediate
    R](https://github.com/uc-r/Intermediate-R) courses.

If you have any specific questions prior to the class you can reach out
to me (Brad Boehmke) directly at <bradleyboehmke@gmail.com>.
